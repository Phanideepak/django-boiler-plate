The error "Object of type Review is not JSON serializable" occurs because Django's session framework by default uses JSON serialization to store data. If you attempt to store an object (like a `Review` model instance) in the session, it will fail because JSON serialization only works with primitive data types (strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, etc.).

### Solutions to Fix This Issue

#### 1. **Serialize the Object**
You can manually serialize the object before storing it in the session, for example, by converting it to a dictionary:

```python
# Assuming 'review' is an instance of your Review model
request.session['review'] = {
    'id': review.id,
    'content': review.content,
    'rating': review.rating
}
```

Then, when retrieving it:

```python
review_data = request.session.get('review')
if review_data:
    # Use review_data to recreate or work with the Review object
    review_id = review_data['id']
    content = review_data['content']
    rating = review_data['rating']
```

#### 2. **Store the Object's ID**
Instead of storing the whole object, you can store its ID in the session and fetch it from the database when needed:

```python
request.session['review_id'] = review.id
```

When retrieving it:

```python
from your_app.models import Review

review_id = request.session.get('review_id')
if review_id:
    review = Review.objects.get(id=review_id)
```

#### 3. **Use a Custom Serializer**
If you need to store more complex objects in the session, you can override the session engine to use a different serializer, such as `pickle`. However, this approach has security implications and is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

To use `pickle`, update your Django settings to use a session engine with `pickle` serialization:

```python
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'
SESSION_SERIALIZER = 'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer'
```

### Recommendation
The best practice is to store only the data you need in the session, usually in a lightweight format like JSON. Storing entire model instances can lead to inefficiencies and security risks. Using option 1 or 2 is typically the safest and most efficient approach.
