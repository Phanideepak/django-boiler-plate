### **One-to-Many Relationships in Django**

A **one-to-many relationship** occurs when one instance of a model is related to multiple instances of another model. In Django, this is implemented using the `ForeignKey` field.

---

### **1. Defining One-to-Many Relationships**

To define a one-to-many relationship, use a `ForeignKey` in the "child" model pointing to the "parent" model.

#### **Example: Blog and Comments**

A **Blog** can have many **Comments**, but each **Comment** belongs to only one **Blog**.

```python
from django.db import models

class Blog(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Comment(models.Model):
    blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="comments")
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Comment by {self.author} on {self.blog.title}"
```

---

### **2. Explanation of Fields**

- **`ForeignKey`**: This defines the one-to-many relationship. Each `Comment` is linked to one `Blog`, but a `Blog` can have multiple `Comments`.
  - `on_delete=models.CASCADE`: Ensures that when a `Blog` is deleted, all its associated `Comments` are also deleted.
  - `related_name="comments"`: Allows reverse querying. You can access all comments for a blog using `blog_instance.comments.all()`.

---

### **3. Register Models in Admin**

To make the models manageable via the Django admin panel, register them in `admin.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Blog, Comment

@admin.register(Blog)
class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'created_at')

@admin.register(Comment)
class CommentAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('author', 'blog', 'created_at')
```

---

### **4. Apply Migrations**

After defining the models, apply migrations to update the database schema:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### **5. Querying One-to-Many Relationships**

Once the relationship is set up, you can query it in both directions:

#### Get All Comments for a Blog:
```python
blog = Blog.objects.get(id=1)
comments = blog.comments.all()  # Uses the `related_name` specified in the ForeignKey
```

#### Get the Blog for a Specific Comment:
```python
comment = Comment.objects.get(id=1)
blog = comment.blog
```

#### Add a Comment to a Blog:
```python
blog = Blog.objects.get(id=1)
comment = Comment.objects.create(blog=blog, author="Alice", content="Great post!")
```

---

### **6. Admin Customization for Inline Comments**

To display and manage comments directly within the blog's admin interface, use `InlineModelAdmin`:

```python
class CommentInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = Comment
    extra = 1  # Number of empty forms to display

@admin.register(Blog)
class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [CommentInline]
```

---

### **7. Accessing Data in Templates**

In your templates, you can display related data using the reverse relationship:

#### Example: Display Blog with Comments
```django
{% for blog in blogs %}
  <h2>{{ blog.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ blog.content }}</p>
  <h3>Comments:</h3>
  <ul>
    {% for comment in blog.comments.all %}
      <li>{{ comment.author }}: {{ comment.content }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endfor %}
```

---

### **8. Use Cases**

- **Blog and Comments**: One blog has many comments.
- **Category and Products**: One category contains multiple products.
- **Author and Books**: One author writes many books.

---

### **9. Summary**

To create a one-to-many relationship in Django:
1. Define a `ForeignKey` field in the "child" model.
2. Use `related_name` for reverse queries.
3. Customize the admin interface using inlines if needed.
4. Query the relationship in both directions for seamless data access.
